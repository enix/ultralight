Ultralight
==========
Ultralight is a small and fast, but partial, STOMP 1.0 message broker and client written in C#. 

Transports
----------
Out of the box Ultralight communicates via websockets. Other transport protocols can easily be added by implementing both the *IStompListener* and *IStompClient* interfaces and registering them at startup.

Supported commands
------------------
Currently Ultralight support a subset of the STOMP 1.0 commands:

* CONNECT
* SUBSCRIBE		(id is supported)
* UNSUBSCRIBE	(id is unsupported)
* SEND

The server can return with:

* MESSAGE
* ERROR
* RECEIPT

Transactions and ack commands are currently unsupported. Wildcards in queues names are ignored, they are treated as string values.

Sample
======
Check out the Example folder, a both a server and an HTML web client written by [Jeff Mesnil](https://github.com/jmesnil/stomp-websocket) are included.

When you start the server a new 'hello there' message is queued to demonstrate message buffering. The first chat client that connects receives this message, subsequent clients won't.

Protocol details
================
For more information about STOMP see:

* [STOMP at Github.com](http://stomp.github.com/)
* [1.0 protocol definitions](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1.0.html)
* [codehause project](http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol)

Credits
=======
* Websockets are provided by [Fleck](https://github.com/statianzo/Fleck)
* The code is loosly based on [acid stomp](https://github.com/danielbenzvi/acidstomp)
* The libraty uses the concurrent collections and it depends on the .net 4.x runtime.
